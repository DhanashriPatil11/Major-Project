Abstract : 
The Bail Reckoner is an AI-driven legal assistance system designed to predict bail 
eligibility and streamline the judicial process for undertrial prisoners, legal aid 
providers, and judicial authorities. It leverages machine learning models to analyze case 
details, offense severity, and legal precedents, providing an automated assessment of 
bail eligibility. Additionally, the system generates AI-powered bail applications, 
reducing manual effort and ensuring accuracy. Built with React.js for the frontend, 
Flask (Python) for the backend, and MySQL/Oracle for database management, it 
ensures seamless data handling. By automating key aspects of bail determination, the 
Bail Reckoner enhances efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in the judicial 
system.
